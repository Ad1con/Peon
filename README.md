Work, Work

I do not provide any help or support and can not give any assurances on anything here working, not crashing you, not being detectable etc.

This is my playground for dev stuff and it does a bunch of improper things. By design, the only documentation is the code, for users that's mostly the commands themselves.

Otherwise, if you found it, feel free to use it for what it's worth.
